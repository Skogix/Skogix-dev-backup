# AI Manager System Project Plan

## Project Setup
- Initialize the project repository.
- Set up the development environment, including necessary dependencies for both JavaScript and Python.

## Core Functionality
### Function Declarations
- Implement `build-declarations.js` and `build-declarations.py` to parse and generate function declarations.
- Ensure these scripts can handle both JavaScript and Python functions.

## Agent Management
### Agent Execution
- Develop `run-agent.js` and `run-agent.py` to manage and execute agents.
- Implement logic to parse arguments, set up the environment, and run agent-specific tasks.

## Tool Management
### Tool Execution
- Implement `run-tool.js` and `run-tool.py` to execute various tools.
- Ensure these scripts can dynamically load and run tool scripts based on input parameters.

## Tool Development
### Demo Tools
- Create `demo_js.js` and `demo_py.py` as examples of tool scripts.
- Implement basic functionality to demonstrate handling of different data types and environment variables.

### Code Execution Tools
- Develop `execute_js_code.js` and `execute_py_code.py` to execute arbitrary code snippets.
- Ensure proper handling of input and output for security and reliability.

## Integration with OpenAI
- Implement logic to interact with OpenAI's API for query handling.
- Ensure the system can construct and send requests to OpenAI and process responses.

## Testing and Validation
- Develop test cases for each component to ensure functionality and reliability.
- Implement automated testing where possible to streamline the validation process.

## Documentation
- Document the project structure, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
- Ensure all scripts and tools have clear and concise documentation.

## Future Enhancements
- Identify potential areas for improvement or additional features.
- Plan for scalability and integration with other systems or APIs.
