The ReAct model is an AI approach developed by Google that enhances the capabilities of language models (LM) by integrating reasoning and acting. Unlike traditional models that excel in narrowly defined tasks, ReAct allows for multi-step decision-making by using an observe-act-observe chain. The model leverages language models' reasoning abilities and aligns them with specific actions based on available tools to accomplish complex tasks. This synergy enables the model to break down tasks, such as querying data or mathematical calculations, into executable steps, greatly enhancing automation capabilities in various applications like ecommerce or customer service.
