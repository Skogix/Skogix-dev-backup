tell me about the file structure and what each folder do in ./
--------
The file structure for the project appears to include several key components:

1. **./tools/**:
   - This directory contains scripts that define individual tools. These tools are essentially functions written in languages like Bash, JavaScript, or Python. The tools are connected with AIChat to perform specific tasks like executing commands.

2. **./agents/**:
   - This folder organizes different agents, which consist of multiple components:
     - `functions.json`: JSON declarations for functions used by the agent, auto-generated.
     - `index.yaml`: Defines the agent, including its name, description, instructions, and configuration variables.
     - `tools.txt`: Lists shared tools that the agent can use, linked from the `/tools` folder.
     - `tools.{sh,js,py}`: Scripts that define agent-specific tools.

3. **./tools.txt**:
   - This file lists tool filenames, each on a new line, which you need to build and use within the project.

4. **./agents.txt**:
   - Similarly, this file lists the names of the agents.

The overall structure is designed to allow you to create, reuse, and manage tools and agents effectively, enabling the integration with AIChat for executing tasks and utilizing AI capabilities.

--------
The directory structure you've shared seems to be a file organization for a project related to AI agents. Here's a brief overview of what each directory might contain based on typical conventions:

- `/ai/agents/`: This directory likely contains various agents such as `argc`, `coder`, `demo`, `react`, and `todo`. Each agent might have a subdirectory for `sessions`, which could be where data or configurations related to their interactions are stored.
  
- `/ai/functions/agents/`: This seems to be where the implementation files for each agent are stored. There's possibly a cache and some compiled Python files in `__pycache__`. The presence of some `docs` directories (like under `react`) suggests there might be documentation relevant to that agent.

- `/ai/functions/bin/`: This could be where compiled binaries or scripts are stored.

- `/ai/functions/cache/`: This directory likely holds temporary files or cached data, as indicated by `tmp`.

- `/ai/functions/scripts/`: This might contain various scripts used by the project.

- `/ai/functions/tools/`: This directory could be for specific tools that each agent might use. The `__pycache__` suggests Python is used here.

- `/ai/rags/`: This could be a directory for storing retrieval-augmented generation resources or files, though context doesn't specify this.

- `/ai/roles/`: This might contain role definitions or configurations used by the AI agents, potentially defining different behaviors or permissions.

If you need further information about any specific part of the structure or how to utilize these directories, please provide additional context or specify your query.
