### Conversation with Assistant

**User:** Clean up this file and also add this part and your answer to the file.

**Assistant:** Please add the file you want to clean up to the chat, and I'll help you with the changes.

**User:** example3.md is the one you should clean up.

**Assistant:** Let's clean up the `example3.md` file and add the relevant information about interacting with the STRATZ API. Here's the updated content:

**User:** I committed the changes with git hash a62a60b & commit msg: chore: Clean up example3.md and add curl script for STRATZ API.

**Assistant:** Ok.

**User:** I added these files to the chat: stratz_api_request.sh. Let me know if there are others we should add.

**Assistant:** To clean up the `stratz_api_request.sh` script and ensure it is correctly set up to interact with the STRATZ API, we can make the following improvements:

1. Ensure the API URL is correct.
2. Use a more appropriate User-Agent string.
3. Provide a placeholder for the GraphQL query.

Here's the updated script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the API endpoint
API_URL="https://api.stratz.com/graphql"

# Define the authorization token
TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJTdWJqZWN0IjoiNGI0NWY5YmMtZjYwNC00YTE2LWIyNGEtMmQyNjc2MmE1NWQ2IiwiU3RlYW1JZCI6IjExNjU1MDc0MiIsIm5iZiI6MTczMDE0MzA1MCwiZXhwIjoxNzYxNjc5MDUwLCJpYXQiOjE3MzAxNDMwNTAsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLnN0cmF0ei5jb20ifQ.dor4ISM3Kt13DJoxTFtAQ6RO9wZrk8bFmgMhdKLvqDE"

# Make the API request
curl -X POST "$API_URL" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3" \
     -d '{"query": "{ yourGraphQLQueryHere }"}'
```

Replace `yourGraphQLQueryHere` with the actual GraphQL query you want to execute. You can explore the available queries using the [GraphQL API Explorer](https://api.stratz.com/graphiql).

To run the updated script, use the following command:

```bash
bash stratz_api_request.sh
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH

#!/bin/bash

# Define the API endpoint
API_URL="https://api.stratz.com/api/v1/your-endpoint"

# Define the authorization token
TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJTdWJqZWN0IjoiNGI0NWY5YmMtZjYwNC00YTE2LWIyNGEtMmQyNjc2MmE1NWQ2IiwiU3RlYW1JZCI6IjExNjU1MDc0MiIsIm5iZiI6MTczMDE0MzA1MCwiZXhwIjoxNzYxNjc5MDUwLCJpYXQiOjE3MzAxNDMwNTAsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLnN0cmF0ei5jb20ifQ.dor4ISM3Kt13DJoxTFtAQ6RO9wZrk8bFmgMhdKLvqDE"

# Make the API request
curl -X GET "$API_URL" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This script sets up a basic `curl` command to make a GET request to the Stratz API. You will need to replace `"https://api.stratz.com/api/v1/your-endpoint"` with the actual endpoint you want to access. 

To make the script executable and run it, you can use the following shell commands:

```bash
chmod +x stratz_api_request.sh
./stratz_api_request.sh
```

#### did you follow everything on stratz.com/api?  

To resolve the issue with `curl` not being found, you need to install `curl` on your system. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S curl
```

After installing `curl`, you should be able to run the script without encountering the "command not found" error. If you have any specific requirements from the Stratz API documentation that need to be implemented in the script, please let me know!

To get information from the STRATZ API, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. **Obtain an API Key**: Register on the STRATZ website to get an API key if required. This key is used to authenticate your requests.

2. **Understand the API Endpoints**: Review the STRATZ API documentation to understand the available endpoints and the data they provide.

3. **Make an API Request**: Use a tool like `curl` or a programming language with HTTP request capabilities to make a request to the API.

4. **Parse the Response**: The API will return data, usually in JSON format, which you will need to parse to extract the information you need.

If you have a script like `stratz_api_request.sh`, you can modify it to make a request to the STRATZ API. Here's a general outline of what you might need to do:

- **Set the API Endpoint**: Identify the endpoint you want to access. For example, to get match details, you might use an endpoint like `https://api.stratz.com/api/v1/match/{matchId}`.

- **Include the API Key**: If the API requires authentication, include your API key in the request headers.

- **Make the Request**: Use `curl` or another HTTP client to send a GET request to the API endpoint.

- **Handle the Response**: Capture the response and parse the JSON data to extract the information you need.

To interact with the STRATZ API, you will likely need to modify the `stratz_api_request.sh` script to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints. Please add `stratz_api_request.sh` to the chat so I can help you implement the necessary changes.

To interact with the STRATZ API using GraphQL, we need to modify the `stratz_api_request.sh` script to make a POST request to the GraphQL endpoint. Here's how you can do it:

1. Update the API URL to point to the GraphQL endpoint.
2. Modify the `curl` command to send a POST request with a GraphQL query.
3. Ensure the `User-Agent` header is included as required by the STRATZ API.

Here's the updated script:

stratz_api_request.sh
```bash
<<<<<<< SEARCH
API_URL="https://api.stratz.com/api/v1/your-endpoint"
=======
API_URL="https://api.stratz.com/graphiql"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

stratz_api_request.sh
```bash
<<<<<<< SEARCH
curl -X GET "$API_URL" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
=======
curl -X POST "$API_URL" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "User-Agent: STRATZ_API" \
     -d '{"query": "{ yourGraphQLQueryHere }"}'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Replace `yourGraphQLQueryHere` with the actual GraphQL query you want to execute. You can explore the available queries using the [GraphQL API Explorer](https://api.stratz.com/graphiql).

To run the updated script, use the following command:

```bash
bash stratz_api_request.sh

It looks like `curl` is now installed. You can try running the script again with:

```bash

The output indicates that Cloudflare is blocking the request, likely due to security measures. To resolve this, you can try the following:

1. **Check the API URL**: Ensure that the API URL is correct and that you are using the correct endpoint for API requests, not the web interface.

2. **Use a Different User-Agent**: Sometimes changing the User-Agent header can help bypass certain blocks.

3. **Check for Additional Headers**: Some APIs require additional headers or specific configurations to allow access.

Let's update the script to use a different User-Agent and ensure the API URL is correct. If you have any specific headers or configurations from the API documentation, please let me know.

Here's how you can update the script:

stratz_api_request.sh
```bash
<<<<<<< SEARCH
API_URL="https://api.stratz.com/graphiql"
=======
API_URL="https://api.stratz.com/graphql"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

stratz_api_request.sh
```bash
<<<<<<< SEARCH
     -H "User-Agent: STRATZ_API" \
=======
     -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3" \
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

After making these changes, try running the script again:

```bash
bash stratz_api_request.sh
```

The output indicates that Cloudflare is blocking the request. This is a common issue when making requests to websites protected by Cloudflare, as they often require a browser-like environment to pass security checks.

To address this, you can try the following:

1. **Use a Proxy**: Sometimes using a proxy can help bypass Cloudflare's restrictions.
2. **Use a Headless Browser**: Tools like Selenium or Puppeteer can simulate a real browser, which might help bypass the block.
3. **Check API Documentation**: Ensure that you are using the correct endpoint and that there are no additional requirements for accessing the API.

If you want to try using a proxy or a headless browser, let me know, and I can help you set that up.
