###  3\. **General Workflow Concepts (Task Management, Optimization)** :

* **Batching and Parallelization** : The idea of **batching similar tasks** and running **parallel tasks** is a common productivity strategy in both manual and automated workflows. Similar concepts can be seen in: 
    * **Agile Methodology** : Agile workflows often emphasize batching tasks into **sprints** or **iterations** , which is essentially grouping similar tasks for efficient progress. Batching and parallel processing are used to maximize team output in limited timeframes. 
    * **Lean Methodology** : In **Lean** systems (used in manufacturing and productivity), the principle of **continuous flow** ensures that similar tasks are grouped together and that workflows are optimized for minimal downtime, reducing waste and increasing efficiency.
