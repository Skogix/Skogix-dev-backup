###  1\. **Rag (Gathering Information)** :

* **Information Gathering** and **Preparation** : The concept of "rag" closely aligns with the **gathering phase** in many project management and workflow systems. This is when relevant data, resources, or context are gathered before starting a task. It’s seen in: 
    * **DevOps Pipelines** : In continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), the build stage often includes a "fetch" or "gather" step, which collects all necessary resources and dependencies before building or deploying software. 
    * **Getting Things Done (GTD)** : In the GTD methodology, the first stage is **“Capture,”** where you gather all inputs, tasks, and information into one system before processing and organizing them. 
    * **Data Pipeline Models** : In **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** systems, the "Extract" step involves gathering data from various sources, similar to how "rag" involves pulling necessary data and resources before acting on them.
