###  2\. **Rolls (Scripts or Programs)** :

* **Automation and Scripting** : The concept of **rolls** is essentially automation via scripts or tools, something that is common in software development, system administration, and process automation. This can be found in: 
    * **Task Automation Systems (like Ansible, Jenkins, etc.)** : Here, automation tools (rolls) handle repetitive or mundane tasks such as deploying code, managing infrastructure, and more. These systems use predefined scripts to handle tasks automatically. 
    * **Cron Jobs and Task Schedulers** : In UNIX/Linux systems, **cron jobs** act as rolls by running scripts or commands on a set schedule, automating things like backups, data syncing, or running routine maintenance scripts. 
    * **Makefiles/Build Systems** : In software development, **Makefiles** or similar build systems like **Gradle** or **CMake** are used to automate building, testing, or deploying code via scripts, which is quite similar to your rolls concept.
