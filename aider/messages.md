## Project Plan

1. **Core Responsibilities:**
   - **Reasoning:** Identify the tasks that need orchestration and determine the best AI agent for each task. Consider the tools and permissions required for each agent.
   - **Action:** Implement a central manager that can delegate tasks to the appropriate agents and manage their execution.
   - **Reflection:** This approach centralizes control, which is good for consistency but may become a bottleneck if not designed for scalability.

2. **Functional Areas:**
   - **Reasoning:** Break down the workstation management into distinct areas like task management, bookmark management, etc. Each area should have specialized agents.
   - **Action:** Develop agents for each functional area, ensuring they have the necessary capabilities and interfaces.
   - **Reflection:** Specialization allows for focused development and optimization, but it requires careful coordination to ensure agents work together seamlessly.

3. **Architecture:**
   - **Reasoning:** Design a robust architecture that supports communication between the AI manager and agents, and allows for easy integration of new agents.
   - **Action:** Create a modular architecture with clear interfaces and protocols for communication.

   - What is the expected scale of the system in terms of the number of agents and tasks it will handle?
   - Are there specific performance benchmarks or constraints we should aim for?

2. **Functional Areas:**
   - Are there additional functional areas or specific tasks you foresee needing in the future?
   - How should agents prioritize tasks when there are conflicting demands?

3. **Architecture and Design:**
   - What are the key architectural principles you want to prioritize (e.g., modularity, performance, ease of use)?
   - Are there specific design patterns or technologies you prefer for the architecture?

4. **Communication Protocols:**
   - Are there specific communication standards or technologies you prefer (e.g., REST, gRPC)?
   - How important is real-time communication versus batch processing for your use case?

5. **Security and Compliance:**
   - What are the most critical security concerns for your use case?
   - Are there specific compliance requirements or industry standards we need to consider?

6. **User Interface:**
   - What are the key features you want in the UI?
   - Are there specific design principles or frameworks you prefer for the UI?

7. **Testing and Deployment:**
   - What is your preferred testing framework or toolset?
   - How frequently do you plan to release updates, and what is your deployment strategy?

Your input on these questions will help tailor the development process to better meet your needs and expectations.
