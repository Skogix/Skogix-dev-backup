# AI Manager for Arch Linux Workstation

## Project Vision

The overall flow of the AI Manager project is to establish a centralized system that efficiently orchestrates specialized AI agents to manage various tasks on an Arch Linux workstation. The goal is to create a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform that seamlessly integrates multiple functional areas like task management, bookmarks, and dotfiles. By focusing on modular architecture, standardized communication protocols, and robust security measures, the project aims to provide a cohesive and reliable user experience. The iterative approach, with continuous testing and user feedback, ensures that the system evolves to meet user needs while maintaining high performance and security standards.

## Overview

The AI Manager is designed to orchestrate multiple AI agents to manage various aspects of an Arch Linux workstation. It acts as a router between the user and specialized AI agents, handling tasks such as todo-lists, bookmarks, dotfiles, and documentation.

## Project Plan

1. **Core Responsibilities:**
   - Orchestrate AI agents.
   - Route user requests.
   - Manage tools and permissions.

2. **Functional Areas:**
   - Task Management
   - Bookmark Management
   - Dotfile Management
   - Documentation Management

3. **Architecture:**
   - Central AI Manager
   - Specialized AI Agents
   - Tool Interface

4. **Communication Protocols:**
   - Define manager-agent communication.
   - Establish user interaction protocols.

5. **Security and Permissions:**
   - Secure tool and data access.
   - Manage agent permissions.

6. **User Interface:**
   - Develop a user-friendly interface.
   - Provide feedback and status updates.

7. **Testing and Iteration:**
   - Conduct component and integration testing.
   - Iterate based on feedback.

## Communication Protocols

The system will establish two primary communication protocols: one between the user and the AI Manager, and another for the AI Manager to issue orders to other AI agents. Further details and specific technologies for these protocols will be determined as the project progresses.

## Architecture and Design

The system will prioritize modularity, utilizing small containers that can spin up when needed and remain dormant otherwise. The preference is to use bash scripts for regular tools, with Python scripts for more complex tool execution. The design will focus on reproducibility, potentially using tools like Ansible, and adhere to the principle of "do one thing and do it well." Comprehensive documentation will be a key focus to ensure clarity and ease of use.

## Task Management Strategy

The system will handle a large number of small tasks, with a focus on manageability rather than time sensitivity. The AI Manager will employ a ReAct-iteration approach, where small agents perform their tasks and provide input for subsequent iterations. This allows tasks to be left running overnight, ensuring that the system can efficiently manage and complete tasks without immediate time constraints.

## Scalability and Performance

The system is expected to handle 10-20 different general tasks, with each task managed by small, modular agents. The core functionality will focus on interpreting user requests, determining the appropriate agent, and managing the necessary tools. The goal is to maintain a modular architecture that allows for easy addition of new agents as needed.

## Project Questions

To proceed effectively, here are some questions that would help clarify the project's direction and requirements:

1. **Scalability and Performance:**
   - What is the expected scale of the system in terms of the number of agents and tasks it will handle?
   - Are there specific performance benchmarks or constraints we should aim for?

2. **Functional Areas:**
   - Are there additional functional areas or specific tasks you foresee needing in the future?
   - How should agents prioritize tasks when there are conflicting demands?

3. **Architecture and Design:**
   - What are the key architectural principles you want to prioritize (e.g., modularity, performance, ease of use)?
   - Are there specific design patterns or technologies you prefer for the architecture?

4. **Communication Protocols:**
   - Are there specific communication standards or technologies you prefer (e.g., REST, gRPC)?
   - How important is real-time communication versus batch processing for your use case?

5. **Security and Compliance:**
   - What are the most critical security concerns for your use case?
   - Are there specific compliance requirements or industry standards we need to consider?

6. **User Interface:**
   - What are the key features you want in the UI?
   - Are there specific design principles or frameworks you prefer for the UI?

7. **Testing and Deployment:**
   - What is your preferred testing framework or toolset?
   - How frequently do you plan to release updates, and what is your deployment strategy?

Your input on these questions will help tailor the development process to better meet your needs and expectations.
